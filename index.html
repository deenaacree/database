<h1>Weatherbase Project: North Central Florida Weather Data</h1>

<div id="weather">

<p>Welcome to The Weatherbase Project. This is a project created by a student at the University of Florida to log weather temperatures throughout various parts of North Central Florida.</p>

<p>As part of this information-gathering project, you can view the previous weather data that has been entered by others, enter more weather data, and edit or delete data that is not correct.</p>

<p>This data can be used by people all over the North Central Florida area in order to learn more about their location's average weather.</p>
