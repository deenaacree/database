<h1>Weatherbase Project: Weather Data</h1>

<div id="weather">

<p>Welcome to the Weatherbase Project. This is a database and storage project hosted by Deena Acree from the University of Florida.</p>

<p>As part of this information-gathering project, you can view the previous weather data that has been entered by others. In addition, you can enter more weather data based on your location for the benefit of the research.</p>

<p>You can also edit information from previous dates if it is not accurate, or delete information if it is no longer relevant to the research.</p>

<p>This data can be used and accessed by people all over the North Central Florida area in order to see information about their location's average weather.</p>
